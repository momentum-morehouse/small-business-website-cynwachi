        <p> <strong> Wild Hyacinth: </strong>This bulbflower naturalizes well in gardens. The bulb grows </br>
            best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest</br>
             areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally</br>
              it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in </br>
              autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn.</br>
               Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.</p>

              <p> <strong> Spring starflower: </strong>These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and </br>
                  Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. </br>
                  These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. They can get up to half a foot tall with a </br>
                  similar spread. Each bulb will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green</br>
                   foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.</p>
