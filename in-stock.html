        <p> <strong> Wild Hyacinth: </strong>This bulbflower <em>naturalizes well in gardens. </em>The bulb grows </br>
            best in well-drained soil high in humus. It will grow in lightly shaded forest</br>
             areas and on rocky outcrops as well as in open meadows or prairies. Additionally</br>
              it is found growing alongside streams and rivers. The plants may be divided in </br>
              autumn after the leaves have withered. Bulbs should be planted in the autumn.</br>
               Additionally the plant spreads by seed rather than by runners.</p>

          <p> <strong> Lily-of-the-Valley:</strong> With its deeply fragrant flowers -- scallop-edge bells that dangle </br>
              above bright emerald-green leaves -- this nearly deer-proof shade lover appears to be </br>
              delicate in an old-fashioned way. But the pretty plant is also an intrepid wanderer,</br>
               spreading readily and rapidly, and anyone who gardens in a small space will want to </br>
               watch this perennial to make sure it stays in bounds. </p>

              <p> <strong> Spring Starflower: </strong>These charming little blooming plants hail from Argentina and </br>
                  Uruguay and form dense clumps of perennial flowers to chase the winter doldrums away. </br>
                  These flowers spring from fall planted bulbs. They can get up to half a foot tall with a </br>
                  similar spread. Each bulb will produce numerous flowering stems with slender, deeply green</br>
                   foliage. Blooms are fragrant and star shaped with six blue or white petals.</p>

                   6 to 8 weeks before a hard frost is expected and when soils are below 60 degrees F. </P>

                   showy blooms in a variety of colors from May to June. Persian buttercups are most </br> 
                   commonly grown from tubers planted in the beginning of spring. Each plant will produce</br>
                    up to 70 blooms in a season. Good for cooler weather; can tolerate light frost.</p>
